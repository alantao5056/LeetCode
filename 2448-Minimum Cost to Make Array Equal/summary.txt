I spend a bit of time thinking about this problem, and then coding it wasn't that hard (very easy to debug and pretty straight forward). However, I spend a lot of time figuring out why my program wasn't working, and then I found out that it was because and integer multiplied by an integer wasn't automatically converted to a long, even though I added it in a long variable. This is a pretty common mistake, and I will try to be careful in the future.
